# RadVisual AI 🏥 ✨
**Patient-Centric Radiology Report Visualizer**

---

## 📖 Overview
**RadVisual AI** is an AI-driven solution designed to bridge the communication gap between radiologists and patients. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 3D medical illustration mapping, the system translates complex, jargon-heavy radiology reports into simplified, visual summaries that patients can actually understand.

### 🎯 The Problem
Patients often receive radiology reports filled with intimidating medical terminology (e.g., "Mild osteophytic lipping," "T2 hypointensity"), leading to unnecessary anxiety and a lack of health literacy.

### 💡 The Solution
A "Visual Translation" engine that:
1. **Parses** complex findings using Medical NLP.
2. **Translates** jargon into Grade-8 level plain English.
3. **Visualizes** the findings using a library of 3D-style anatomical illustrations.
